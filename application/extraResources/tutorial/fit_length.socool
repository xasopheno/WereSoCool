{ f: 240, l: 1, g: 1/5, p: 0 }

-- Once you've started writing songs with Overlays, you'll likely notice
-- that lining up the ends of phrases can be tedious. 
-- Luckily, the "FitLength" operations makes it super easy to align
-- the ends of operations. 

-- The syntax is as follows:
--    operation2 | FitLength operation1

-- Here, operation2 is something new you've written. 
-- operation1 is something you wrote earlier in the piece.
-- FitLength is going to stretch or squish operation2
-- to make it the same length as operation1. 
-- *** Currently, FitLength needs to be the final operation in a block. 

-- In this example, you'll also see "Invert" being used.
-- Invert is an operation on Frequency which inverts the ratio of the current
-- current frequency over the f at the top of the file. 
--    Here are some examples:
--        Fm 3/2 | Invert == Fm 2/3
--        Fm 2 | Fm 2 | Invert == Fm 1/4

-- This is the bassline. 
bassline = {
  -- It has a small overtone structure
  O[
    (1/1, 0, 1/2, 0),
    (1/1, -1/2, 1/2, 0),
-- 1/2 because we want the fundamental to be 
-- lower (1 octave lower)
    (1/2, 0, 1, 0),
