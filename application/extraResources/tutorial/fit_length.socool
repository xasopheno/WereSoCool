-- Once you've started writing songs with Overlays, you'll likely notice
-- that lining up the ends of phrases can be tedious. 
-- Luckily, the "FitLength" operations makes it super easy to align
-- the ends of operations. 

-- The syntax is as follows:
--    operation2 > FitLength operation1 ***notice the ">" used here.

-- In this example, operation2 is something new you've written. 
-- operation1 is something you wrote earlier in the piece.
-- FitLength is going to stretch or squish operation2
-- to make it the same length as operation1. 
-- *** Currently, FitLength needs to the final operation in a block. 

-- In this example, you'll also see "Invert" being used.
-- Invert is an operation on Frequency. Here are some examples:
-- Fm 3/2 | Invert == Fm 2/3
-- Fm 2 | Fm 2 | Invert == Fm 1/4
