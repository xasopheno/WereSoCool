-- Overlay lets you to render more than one Operation at the same time. 
-- For example, Overlay [Fm 1, Fm 3/2] would play those two operations
-- at the same time. 

-- Let's also add a few more simple Operations into the mix:
-- Fa (Frequency Addition) like Fm, is an operation applied to the
-- frequency of any Operations passed in.
--   - Fa -10 moves the frequency down 10hz, Fa 4 moves up 4hz.
-- Pa (Pan Addition) is an operation for changing panning. 
--   - Negative values move left, positive values move right. 
--   - You can use larger values, but a range of (-1, 1) is usually plenty.
-- Gm (Gain Multiply) is an operation for changing volume
--   - Larger numbers are louder. 

-- You can make cool sounds by overlaying frequencies that 
-- are very close together. The sound will oscillate
-- because the two waveforms will move between supporting
-- each other and cancelling each other out. 
cool_chord = {
-- I recommend listening to this by slowly uncommenting out
-- each set of frequencies and then rendering again.

-- *** Remember you can use cmd + / to comment/uncomment lines.
-- You can uncomment multiple lines at the same time.***
