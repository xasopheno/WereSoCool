WereSoCool is a programming language for composing microtonal music geometrically. This language doesn't assume
familiarity with either microtonal music or computer programming, but experience with either will certainly help. I
recommend starting with the tutorials and when you feel sufficiently confident, just try making some cool things.
There's no better way to learn than to make stuff. 

## Listen:

Watch/Listen to some examples form the langauage [here](https://www.weresocool.org/play/arcs).

## Make Cool Sounds:

### Macos:

The most recent version of the Macos application can be downloaded [here](https://www.weresocool.org/downloads).
Inside, you'll find a lot of cool tutorials and demos that should help you get started. If you get stuck, please do not
hesitate to reach out to me weresocool at xasopheno dot com. 

### Linux:
Currently on linux, you'll need to compile this locally. See Development. 


### Windows
This does not currently work on Windows...<sad panda>. If you're interested in using this software on a Windows machine, please
    reach out and I'll work on it. 


## Development:

### Setup
You'll need Rust. Rust is a great language. Install it with [Rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html).
You'll need also need [portaudio](https://github.com/RustAudio/rust-portaudio) and [lame](https://lame.sourceforge.io/)

#### Macos:
`brew install portaudio pkg-config lame`

#### Arch:
`sudo pacman -S portaudio pkg-config lame`

#### Ubuntu:
`sudo apt-get portaudio pkg-config lame`

### Build
`make package`

## Run: 
#### Linux
`make run`

#### Macos
`make run_osx`

## Run with Dev Server
